## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project was made for an an Udacity Nanodegree project. My aim was to compare data in Stackoverflow's 2018 and 2019 surveys to find answers to the followin questions:</br>
1. What are the countries with the highest percentage of employed programmers? </br>
2. What are the most common contracts offered? </br>
3. What are the top programming languages used at work? </br>
